# c314-utils

> Small Rust utilities

## Usage

Add the following to the dependencies section of your Cargo.toml file.

```toml
c314-utils = "0.2.0"
```

Now you can use it like this:

```rust
use c314-utils::prelude::ToStaticStr;

fn main() {
    let converted_from_string_to_str = String::from("Hello World1").to_static_str();
    println!("{}", converted_from_string_to_str);
}
```

Currently only contains ToStaticStr, if you have any ideas, please create an issue at [github.com/314ShadePi/c314-utils](https://github.com/314ShadePi/c314-utils)

I created this library to make [Yew](https://crates.io/crates/yew) do as I wanted
